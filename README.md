# WikiConnect

**WikiConnect** is an engaging and educational game that challenges players to connect two Wikipedia articles by navigating through other articles with the fewest clicks possible. The game is designed to test and improve your knowledge of various topics, your understanding of how different subjects are interrelated, and your ability to think strategically.

## How It Works
- **Starting and Ending Points:** The game begins by selecting a starting article and an ending article on Wikipedia. You can either choose these manually or let the game select them randomly for an extra challenge.
  
- **Navigating Through Articles:** Once the game starts, you'll see the selected starting article displayed on the screen. Your task is to reach the ending article by clicking on the hyperlinks within the articles you visit. Each hyperlink leads you to another Wikipedia article, and you continue this process until you reach the target article.

- **Creating Nodes:** As you click through articles, each visited page creates a node in your path, helping you visualize your progress. The objective is to create the shortest possible path from the start to the end article.

- **Interactive Interface:** The game's interface displays the current article with its hyperlinks, allowing you to choose your next move carefully. You can track your nodes on a map that shows how far you've come and where you need to go next.

## Features
- **Random Article Selection:** If you want an extra challenge, you can opt for the random selection of both starting and ending articles.
- **Live Visualization:** The game provides a visual representation of the nodes you've created, helping you track your path and strategize your next moves.
- **Responsive Design:** The game is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth experience across different devices.
